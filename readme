Tips
If navigation doesn't work on android
react-native-screens package requires one additional configuration step to properly work on Android devices. Edit MainActivity.kt or MainActivity.java file which is located under android/app/src/main/java/<your package name>/.
Add the highlighted code to the body of MainActivity class:

Changing the file with custom navigator causes freeze of the app and it need to be reloaded

Pnpm doesn't work with expo/react-native, expo-router.

If something is not working, ex: navigate to route, then run npx expo start -c to clean cache, sometimes it helps.

Splash screen image should remain with the same name because it is used in SplashScreenComponent. If it is updated make sure to update it in component too 

By default splash animation is not shown in dev env, it can be forced to play by passing a flag option

Use a dev splash image and a production because the production blinks on resfresh and it is iritated

Do not use conditioinal logic in _layout file with slot: predicate ? <Slot/> : <Text>Loading...</Text>

Enva variable set from command line loads the required env file but process.env.NODE_ENV remains with development value. Set a custom ENV vars in every .env file.
